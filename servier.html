            <p>Services are mainly seen as activities that people can buy and sell. They are tightly associated with
                goods but, unlike them, services cannot be stored and transported. It can also be said that they exist
                only within a particular period because they can be observed only when being performed. Services are
                offered by different organizations just like ordinary goods. The extent to which the focus is put on
                them is defined by the peculiarities of a particular company. Based on a tangible-intangible continuum,
                professionals identify such types of offerings as:Today people are living in the era of consumption that
                is associated with the desire of the representatives of the general public to buy the things they want
                to have. They emphasize the fact that there is no necessity already to try hard to reach some unique
                products or to do something without any external help because it is much easier to obtain various
                offerings with the help of third parties.Pure tangible good (sugar) Tangible good with accompanying
                services (computer repair) Hybrid (cafe) Major service with minor goods and services (flight) Pure
                service (psychotherapy) Services are mainly characterized by their: Intangibility. Customers are not
                able to perceive services with their senses (for instance, it is impossible to see them or hear) before
                they are bought. That is why some people tend to question the quality of particular services. However,
                such uncertainty can be overcome if organizations focus on the ways they can ensure potential clients
                that the place, material, price, and other critical constitutes are reasonable and good enough.
                Organizations should manage the evidence for abstract offers so that they appeal to customers.</p>
